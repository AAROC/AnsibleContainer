Docker images are often personal expressions of their author, and thus contain many of their flaws.
No matter how simple the image, there's almost always room for improvement:

  1. Please feel free to send pull requests for suggestions on optimising the build. These will likely be accepted if the resulting image is :
    1. smaller
    1. more secure
    1. builds faster
    without sacrificing functionality.
  1. If you find any issues or problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AAROC/AnsibleContainer/issues/new) in the GitHub repo.
  1. If you would like to discuss any aspect of the code, [start a topic on the discussion forum](https://discourse.sci-gaia.eu)
